# Tasks: Verification & Cleanup

**Feature**: `001-physical-ai-robotics-book`
**Status**: Pending
**Input**: Implementation completed in previous turns. Verification required.

## Dependencies
- **Phase 1 (Branding)**: Depends on `docusaurus.config.ts` update.
- **Phase 2 (Cleanup)**: Depends on successful verification.

## Phase 1: Verification
*Goal: Confirm all visual changes are correctly applied.*

- [ ] T001 [US1] [P] Verify "Built with Docusaurus" is removed from footer in `tmp_docusaurus_project/docusaurus.config.ts`
- [ ] T002 [US1] [P] Verify "Written by AIDD" exists in footer copyright in `tmp_docusaurus_project/docusaurus.config.ts`
- [ ] T003 [US1] Verify `img/robotics-logo.png` is used in both Navbar and Hero section
- [ ] T004 [US1] Verify Blog Post "Introducing the Future..." exists in `tmp_docusaurus_project/blog/`

## Phase 2: Cleanup (Optional)
*Goal: Remove any temporary assets or unused defaults.*

- [ ] T005 [P] Check for any unused default blog posts (e.g., "Welcome", "Long Blog Post") and flag for removal if needed (Manual check)

## Implementation Strategy
Since the implementation commands were executed in the previous turns (Logo copy, Config update, Blog creation), this task list is purely for verification to ensure the state is as expected before closing the feature.

## Parallel Execution Opportunities
- All verification tasks can run in parallel.
