# Tasks: AI-Generated Book Project

**Feature Branch**: `001-ai-book` | **Date**: 2025-11-29 | **Plan**: /home/abdullahiqbal/Abdullah/hackathon-book-project/specs/001-ai-book/plan.md
**Input**: Implementation plan from `/home/abdullahiqbal/Abdullah/hackathon-book-project/specs/001-ai-book/plan.md`

**Note**: This file is generated by the `/sp.tasks` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/tasks.md` for the execution workflow.

## Implementation Strategy

We will adopt an MVP-first approach, prioritizing core book creation, RAG chatbot, and basic authentication functionality. Bonus features will be integrated incrementally after the core deliverables are stable and verified. Development will follow an iterative process, with continuous integration and deployment.

## Dependency Graph (User Story Completion Order)

1.  **Phase 1: Setup**
2.  **Phase 2: Foundational**
3.  **Phase 3: User Stories (P1)** (US1, US2, US3 - can be parallelized after foundational setup)
4.  **Phase 4: User Stories (P2)** (US4, US5 - can be parallelized after P1 stories)
5.  **Phase 5: User Stories (P3)** (US6 - dependent on foundational setup)
6.  **Phase 6: Bonus Features & Polish** (dependent on all core user stories)
