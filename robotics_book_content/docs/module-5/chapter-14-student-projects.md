# Student Projects: Hands-on Physical AI Robotics

This section provides detailed, beginner-friendly guides for three capstone projects designed to reinforce the concepts taught in the "Complete Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" textbook. Each project progressively builds on the skills acquired, moving from basic perception and control to advanced autonomous navigation and manipulation.
